          Deepanshi, on this rose day , i wasn't able to bring you flowers 
          but that doesn't mean that you ain't getting my love. from the
          day that you came in my life , i started loving everything in this world. 
          In short , I want to thank you , for making my
          life as beautiful as a garden full of flowers.
          (roses isliye ni laaya coz ghr pe kaise deta aur tu rakhti kaha)
          just roses won't be able to express my love for you.
          lotsss of love
